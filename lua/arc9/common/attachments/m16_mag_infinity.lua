ATT.Description = [["Anyway, the Patriot is a one-of-a-kind sidearm made especially for The Boss. It's basically an XM16E1 with the barrel cut short and the stock taken off. The idea was to create a large pistol that combined the feel and quick handling of a handgun with the force of a rifle. But with a barrel that short, the recoil is unbelievable. It's tough to aim, but it more than makes up for it in firepower. From the looks of it, it's fitted with a 100-round drum magazine... And it never runs out of ammo?"

"Never."

"Why's that?"

"Because the internal feed mechanism is shaped like an infinity symbol."

"Ah, I get it. Yep, that'll give you unlimited ammo."]]
