Tactical Accessories provide a unique function and may come with penalties.
Usually don't affect stats.
You can equip multiple of these.
Some stocks, foregrips, and barrels provide extra Tactical slots.
 - Flashlight: Light up the area in front of the player.
 - Floodlight: Wide-beam flashlight with greater radius but shorter range.
 - Xenon Light: Flashlight with thinner beam, but brighter overall.
 - Laser Aiming Module: See your hip fire aim point. Reduces free aim radius.
 - Multiverse Scavenger: Scours the multiverse for ammunition of the type you need and brings it straight to your reserve. Gives you random amounts of ammo at random intervals.
 - Impact Scavenger: Successful hits return a round to reserve.
 - Pyrrhic Scavenger: Taking damage regenerates ammunition.
 - Nanite Scavenger: Regenerates small amounts of ammunition regularly from trace minerals around you.
 - Ballistic Computer: Show range and predicted impact point/dispersion radius.
 - Corner-Cam: Show PIP view while blind firing. Replaces minimap.
 - Directional Microphone: Ping enemies who fire unsuppressed weapons on minimap.
 - Forward-Looking Radar: Ping enemies directly in front of you, even through walls.
 - Counter-Intel Scanner: Ping enemies with an intel device equipped.
 - Motion Tracker: Ping enemies around you in a short radius.
 - Quantum Phase Warning Receiver: Ping enemies looking directly at you.
 - Biomass Recycler: Regenerate health on kill.
 - Visual Link: Minimap pings can be seen in 3D.
 - Capacity Tracker: Display precise magazine capacity.
 - Solar Charger: Regenerate SUIT slowly over time.
 - Reciprocal Charger: Regenerate SUIT when you fire.

Ammo Type
 - TMJ Rounds: More penetration
 - HEI Rounds: Greater damage, worse muzzle velocity, no penetration
 - JHP Rounds: Worse AP, better close range damage

Trigger (Invisible)
 - Hyperburst Trigger: Fire two shots at once in rapid succession.
 - Watertight Trigger: Fire underwater.
 - Light Trigger: Increased fire rate, worse recoil control.
 - Heavy Trigger: Reduced fire rate, better recoil stability.
 - Assassin Trigger: Adds trigger delay, but greatly improves precision.
 - Accelerator Trigger: Start slow, increase in fire rate with each shot.
